# 🚀 RPC Node Provider Service

## Overview

This section will detail the **RPC Node Provider Service** architecture and its data flow components once fully documented. The service is responsible for enabling high-performance, scalable, and secure communication with various blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin & etc) through RPC endpoints.

Providers like **NowNodes**, **Infura**, **Alchemy**, and others are being analyzed for the system to ensure reliable access to blockchain data and transactions.

### Key Responsibilities (To Be Expanded)

- Establishing secure RPC connections to multiple blockchain networks
- Load balancing and failover support across different providers
- Rate limiting and API key-based access control
- Monitoring node health and uptime

> ⚙️ This section is currently under documentation and will be populated once the RPC service infrastructure and DFD visualizations are finalized.
