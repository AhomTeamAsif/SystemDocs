# 5. ER Diagram

## ðŸ§© Overview

We have an **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram** that captures the data model architecture across all core modules of the platform. It defines how entities such as users, subscriptions, tokens, exchanges, and data sources relate to each other. The ER diagram is designed to support modular scalability and provide clarity in how data is organized and interlinked throughout the system.

The ER diagram is maintained on an external collaboration board for visualization. You can access it using the link below:
