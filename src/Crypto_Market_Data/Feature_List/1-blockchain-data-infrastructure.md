# Blockchain Data Infrastructure

This module outlines the core components responsible for integrating, processing, and managing blockchain data across multiple networks. It ensures high-speed, reliable, and accurate data access necessary for real-time decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

## BC-001: Multi-Chain Node Integration

**Description**  
Establishes direct connections to over 100 blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, and Solana. Supports both EVM and non-EVM chains through persistent WebSocket and RPC connections.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Direct integration eliminates dependency on third-party providers, ensuring authenticity and reducing latency. It enables the platform to access raw blockchain data immediately upon block confirmation.

**Scope**

- Maintain connections to 100+ blockchain networks
- Support both EVM and non-EVM chains
- Manage network-specific protocols and data formats
- Provide failover mechanisms for node connectivity

## BC-002: Real-Time Block Processing

**Description**  
Processes each new block within 1â€“3 seconds of confirmation across all supported networks. Parses headers, extracts transaction data, and detects significant events.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Block-level events drive the crypto market. Processing them in real-time ensures detection of swaps, transfers, and interactions instantlyâ€”providing accurate, up-to-date data to users.

**Scope**

- Parse block data within 1â€“3 seconds of confirmation
- Extract all transactions and relevant details
- Detect DEX swaps, token transfers, smart contract interactions
- Handle high-throughput chains with sub-second block times
- Manage processing queues for simultaneous block events

## BC-003: Event Log Extraction

**Description**  
Decodes smart contract events (e.g., swaps, mints, burns, liquidity changes) across 200+ DEX protocols using a contract ABI and signature database.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Smart contract events provide the raw data for interpreting market activity. Accurate event extraction is critical for pricing, volume analytics, and liquidity monitoring.

**Scope**

- Decode events from 200+ DEX protocols
- Maintain updated ABI databases for major contracts
- Handle proxy contracts and upgradeable implementations
- Extract pricing and volume data from AMM events
- Support multiple event formats and standards

## BC-004: Multi-Node Redundancy

**Description**  
Implements automatic failover mechanisms between primary and backup nodes per blockchain network to ensure uninterrupted data flow.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Blockchain nodes may become unresponsive or lag behind. Redundancy ensures high availability, uptime, and data consistency across networks.

**Scope**

- Maintain multiple node connections per network
- Implement automatic failover logic
- Monitor node health and synchronization status
- Load-balance across active nodes
- Enable graceful degradation during failures

## BC-005: Chain Reorganization Handling

**Description**  
Detects and manages blockchain reorganizations (reorgs) when previously confirmed blocks are invalidated due to longer chains being adopted.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Reorgs can lead to incorrect data if not handled properly. This mechanism ensures that stale data is reverted and replaced with accurate, canonical information.

**Scope**

- Detect reorganizations across all networks
- Revert invalidated data from orphaned blocks
- Reprocess data from the new canonical chain
- Notify downstream systems of corrections
- Maintain audit trails for all reorg events
