## DEX-001: Protocol Coverage

**Description**  
Supports over 200 DEX protocols across all major blockchain networks, handling varied smart contract interfaces, AMM formulas, and trading mechanisms.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
DEX trading forms a significant part of cryptocurrency volume. Covering a wide range of protocols ensures users have access to the full DeFi market landscape.

**Scope**

- Support 200+ DEX protocols across major chains
- Handle different AMM types (constant product, stable swaps, concentrated liquidity)
- Support order book and hybrid DEX models
- Manage protocol-specific features and parameters
- Track protocol upgrades and new versions

## DEX-002: Automated Pool Discovery

**Description**  
Automatically detects new trading pairs and liquidity pools created across supported DEX protocols, maintaining comprehensive and up-to-date market coverage.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
New pools emerge continuously in DeFi without advance notice. Automated discovery ensures no opportunity is missed.

**Scope**

- Monitor pool creation events on all protocols
- Index new trading pairs automatically
- Validate pool legitimacy and filter scam tokens
- Track pool metadata and configurations
- Maintain updated registry of active pools

## DEX-003: AMM Price Calculation

**Description**  
Calculates accurate token prices using the specific AMM formulas employed by various DEX protocols, covering simple and complex multi-asset curves.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
DEX prices are formula-based rather than order book-driven. Accurate calculations enable correct market data and arbitrage detection.

**Scope**

- Support all major AMM formula types
- Handle dynamic parameters including fees
- Calculate prices for multi-hop swaps
- Account for slippage and price impact
- Provide price quotes for different trade sizes

## DEX-005: Cross-Chain Pool Tracking

**Description**  
Tracks identical token pairs across multiple blockchain networks to enable cross-chain price comparison and identify arbitrage opportunities.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Tokens often exist on multiple chains, and price differences can be exploited. Cross-chain tracking provides insight into multi-chain token dynamics.

**Scope**

- Identify equivalent tokens across different chains
- Track cross-chain price disparities
- Monitor bridge activity and token transfers
- Calculate cross-chain arbitrage opportunities
- Provide unified multi-chain token views
