# Rate Limiting & Quota Management

This module ensures fair and efficient resource allocation by enforcing tiered rate limits, usage quotas, and dynamic adjustments, protecting platform stability and user experience.

## RL-001: Tiered Rate Limiting

**Description**  
Implements rate limiting based on subscription tiers, balancing fair resource access, abuse prevention, and system performance.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Prevents overload and abuse, incentivizes subscriptions, and maintains service quality for all users.

**Scope**

- Per-tier rate limits (requests per minute/hour/day)
- Endpoint-specific rate limiting
- Burst allowances for short-term traffic spikes
- Rate limit headers and client feedback
- Automatic limit increases for higher tiers
- Custom rate limits for enterprise clients

---

## RL-002: Usage Quotas

**Description**  
Manages quotas for API calls, data access, and other metrics, tracking usage and enforcing subscription limits with transparency.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Controls costs and resource use, supports usage-based pricing, and helps users optimize consumption.

**Scope**

- Monthly and daily quotas
- Different quota categories (API calls, data points, historical data)
- Real-time tracking and enforcement
- Quota reset cycles and carryover policies
- Usage notifications and warnings
- Upgrade options and recommendations

## RL-003: Fair Usage Policies

**Description**  
Enforces policies preventing abuse while allowing legitimate high-volume usage via anomaly detection and automated actions.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Protects platform from abuse, maintains quality, and reduces manual overhead through automation.

**Scope**

- Automated abuse detection algorithms
- Progressive enforcement (warnings, throttling, blocking)
- Appeal and review processes
- Whitelist for verified high-volume users
- Usage pattern analysis and optimization
- Violation reporting and analytics

## RL-004: Dynamic Rate Adjustment

**Description**  
Adjusts rate limits dynamically based on system load, user behavior, and subscription status to optimize resources and experience.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Ensures optimal resource use and flexibility to adapt to changing conditions.

**Scope**

- System load-based rate adjustments
- User behavior-based limit optimization
- Predictive scaling and adjustments
- A/B testing for rate limit strategies
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Automated adjustments aligned with SLA requirements
