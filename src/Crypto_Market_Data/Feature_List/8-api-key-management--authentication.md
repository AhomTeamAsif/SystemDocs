# API Key Management & Authentication

This module provides secure and flexible API key lifecycle management and authentication mechanisms, ensuring controlled and auditable programmatic access to platform services.

## AK-001: API Key Generation & Management

**Description**  
Enables users to generate, manage, and rotate API keys securely, supporting multiple keys per user with descriptive naming and scope-based permissions.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
API keys authenticate programmatic access. Robust key management secures access while offering flexibility for diverse integrations.

**Scope**

- Secure API key generation with cryptographic randomness
- Multiple keys per user with descriptive names
- Key rotation and expiration policies
- Scope-based permissions for fine-grained access control
- Usage tracking and analytics
- Secure encrypted key storage

## AK-002: API Authentication Middleware

**Description**  
Provides centralized middleware to validate API keys, check permissions, and enforce secure access control across all API endpoints.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Ensuring every API request is authenticated and authorized protects data security and enables usage monitoring.

**Scope**

- Fast API key validation and lookup
- Permission checks based on key scopes
- Request signature validation for sensitive operations
- IP whitelisting and geo-restrictions
- Threat detection and automatic request blocking
- Detailed authentication logs

## AK-003: Internal Service Authentication

**Description**  
Manages secure authentication between internal services using JWT tokens, mutual TLS, and service mesh security to prevent unauthorized access.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Internal service communication must be secured to prevent data leaks and unauthorized access.

**Scope**

- Service-to-service JWT token management
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) for internal communications
- Service identity and certificate lifecycle management
- Internal API gateway enforcing authentication
- Integration with service mesh security frameworks

## AK-004: Key Scope & Permissions

**Description**  
Allows creation of API keys with specific scopes and permissions, enforcing least privilege access to only authorized endpoints and data.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Different applications need different access levels. Scoped keys reduce security risks by limiting exposure.

**Scope**

- Granular permission scopes (read, write, admin)
- Endpoint-specific access control
- Data type and asset-level filtering
- Time-based access restrictions
- Custom permission sets for enterprise clients
