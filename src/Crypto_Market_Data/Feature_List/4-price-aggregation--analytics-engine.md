## PA-001: Multi-Source Price Consensus

**Description**  
Aggregates price data from over 100 centralized exchanges (CEX) and 200 decentralized exchanges (DEX) using volume-weighted algorithms to produce a single authoritative price per trading pair.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Prices vary across venues. A multi-source consensus price minimizes outliers and manipulation effects, providing a true reflection of market value.

**Scope**

- Aggregate prices from 100+ CEX and 200+ DEX sources
- Implement volume-weighted consensus algorithms
- Handle diverse price formats and pair conventions
- Provide confidence intervals for price estimates
- Support both real-time and historical consensus pricing

## PA-002: Outlier Detection Algorithm

**Description**  
Employs statistical methods to identify and filter erroneous price data caused by exchange errors or manipulation, preserving data quality.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Faulty prices can distort consensus. Detecting and filtering outliers ensures reliable data integrity.

**Scope**

- Statistical analysis of price deviations
- Real-time outlier detection and filtering
- Historical pattern validation
- Configurable sensitivity parameters
- Maintain audit trails of filtered data points

## PA-003: Exchange Weight Calculation

**Description**  
Dynamically assigns weights to exchanges based on volume, reliability, and data quality to influence consensus prices appropriately.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Exchanges differ in reliability and significance. Weighting ensures trustworthy venues have more influence.

**Scope**

- Volume-based weighting algorithms
- Reliability scoring from historical data
- Real-time adjustment of weights
- Transparent weighting methodology
- Historical tracking and analysis of weights

## PA-006: VWAP Calculations

**Description**  
Calculates Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP) metrics over customizable timeframes, supporting institutional benchmarks.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
VWAP and TWAP are key benchmarks in institutional and algorithmic trading, aiding performance evaluation and fair value assessment.

**Scope**

- Compute VWAP over multiple timeframes
- Support custom trading sessions and periods
- Adjust calculations for market volatility and conditions
- Provide historical VWAP data
- Enable institutional trading benchmark support

## PA-007: Fair Value Estimation

**Description**  
Estimates the fair value of assets by combining multi-source prices, volume data, and market depth to reflect true market value accurately.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Fair value provides a baseline for evaluating current prices and identifying good investment opportunities.

**Scope**

- Multi-factor fair value models integrating fundamental and technical factors
- Real-time updates on fair value
- Confidence intervals and uncertainty metrics
- Historical tracking of fair value estimates
