# Centralized Exchange (CEX) Integration

This module focuses on connecting to a wide range of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges to collect market data, trade history, and monitor exchange health, enabling comprehensive and reliable market insights.

## CEX-001: Multi-Exchange API Integration

**Description**  
Establishes direct connections to over 100 centralized exchanges using both REST APIs and WebSocket feeds. It handles diverse API specifications, authentication methods, and provides a unified data collection framework.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Centralized exchanges dominate trading volume and price discovery. Integrating many exchanges ensures broad market coverage, redundancy against outages, and access to diverse trading pairs.

**Scope**

- Connect to 100+ centralized exchanges
- Support various authentication methods (API keys, OAuth, etc.)
- Handle multiple API formats and protocols (REST, WebSocket)
- Manage exchange-specific configurations and updates

## CEX-002: Real-Time Price Feeds

**Description**  
Collects live price updates from all connected exchanges with sub-100 millisecond latency, normalizing data and distributing updates efficiently to downstream consumers.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Prices fluctuate rapidly in crypto markets. Real-time feeds enable timely trading decisions, arbitrage opportunities, and accurate market snapshots.

**Scope**

- Collect price updates with <100ms latency
- Handle high-frequency updates and spikes
- Normalize prices across exchanges for consistency
- Detect and filter erroneous or outlier data
- Distribute updates via low-latency channels

## CEX-003: Trade History Collection

**Description**  
Gathers comprehensive trade execution data from all exchanges, including price, volume, timestamp, and trade direction. Supports replay and historical analysis.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Trade history underpins volume metrics, technical indicators, and market analysis, revealing true trading activity beyond just price data.

**Scope**

- Collect real-time trade executions
- Store detailed data: price, volume, time, side (buy/sell)
- Handle trade corrections and cancellations
- Support multiple trade types (market, limit, stop)
- Provide historical replay functionality

## CEX-004: Exchange Health Monitoring

**Description**  
Continuously tracks API response times, error rates, availability, and data quality metrics for all connected exchanges, providing reliability scores and alerting on issues.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Exchange APIs vary in reliability. Monitoring health ensures data accuracy, allows dynamic data source weighting, and triggers failover if needed.

**Scope**

- Monitor API response time and uptime
- Track error rates and timeouts
- Assess and score data quality and consistency
- Generate reliability metrics for exchanges
- Alert operators on exchange-specific issues

---

## CEX-005: Rate Limit Management

**Description**  
Intelligently manages API rate limits across exchanges through request queuing, prioritization, and throttling to maximize data throughput without violating usage policies.

**Why This Feature Exists**  
Exchanges impose strict API rate limits; exceeding them causes bans or suspensions. Managing limits smartly ensures uninterrupted data collection.

**Scope**

- Track rate limits per exchange and endpoint
- Queue and prioritize API requests dynamically
- Throttle requests based on real-time usage
- Predict and prevent potential rate limit violations
- Optimize request patterns for efficiency
