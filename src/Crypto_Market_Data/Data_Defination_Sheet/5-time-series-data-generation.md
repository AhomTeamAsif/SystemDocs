# Time-Series Data Generation

### Overview

This document outlines the data models required to support the platform's Time-Series Data Generation engine. These structures are designed to store standardized OHLCV data, detailed volume analytics, and definitions for custom client aggregations. The models also include mechanisms for tracking data quality and the application of interpolation to ensure the integrity and completeness of all time-series data.

### Relations between Tables

- **Ohlcv table**: The primary table for storing standardized candlestick data. It is populated by the time-series engine and serves as the foundation for most technical analysis. It includes a field to distinguish between real and interpolated data.
- **AggregatedVolume table**: This table provides a more granular view of trading volume, breaking it down by source (CEX market or DEX pool) and other dimensions. It supports detailed volume analysis that goes beyond the total volume in the Ohlcv table.
- **CustomAggregationDefinition table**: Belongs to a User (or an institutional client account). It stores the parameters for non-standard timeframes, allowing clients to save and reuse their custom aggregation rules.
- **TimeSeriesLog table**: An audit log that records significant events related to the time-series generation process, such as data quality validation failures or the application of interpolation algorithms.

### Ohlcv (Revised)

Stores aggregated Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume (candlestick) data for a specific market, supporting TS-001. This is a revised version of the previously defined table.
