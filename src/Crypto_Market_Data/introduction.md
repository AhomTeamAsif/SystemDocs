# 1. Introduction

# Crypto Market Data Aggregator

This institutional-grade cryptocurrency market intelligence platform has been proposed by **Sagar, Walid, and Asif** from the blockchain team at **ALXICORN**, in response to organizational requirements for comprehensive market data solutions.

The prototype that we have built is available here -> <a href="https://price-api-server-demo.onrender.com/docs" target="_blank">ðŸ”— Crypto Price Prototype </a>

## Overview

This platform delivers institutional-grade cryptocurrency market intelligence through a unified data pipeline connecting:

- **100+ blockchain networks** with real-time node integration
- **200+ decentralized exchanges** with automated liquidity tracking
- **100+ centralized exchanges** with sub-100ms price feeds

Inspired by CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap, we provide mathematically-verified market data for trading systems, analysts, and blockchain applications.
